    <h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
    <div class="guides" id="Strange">
        <h3>Dr.Strange</h3>
        <p>
            Dr. Strange is a sheild vanguard. However, instead of the role of a controller this hero is much better at taking aggressive space. By ultiziing cover you can get right up onto an enemy and use the dispel darkness ability for big aoe damage.
            This allows Strange's ultimae abilty to be charged quickly. When going for an ultimate you should have your darkness charged up nearly but not all the way to 100%. When using your ultimate you should notice you can see the souls of stuns enemiess.
            By lineing yourself up so your dispel darkness ability can hit both the enemy and their soul you can one shot enemies while at 100% darkness. When looking for to use your ultimate it does not have to target the whole enemy. Try to target at least 1 or 2
            enemies. One of them ideally being an support. Before doing this remember you can be stunned out of your ultimate, so try to use cover and keep track of what enemies have abilities that threaten you and their cooldowns.
        </p>

    <div class="guides" id="Magneto">
        <h3>Magneto</h3>
        <p>
            Magneto excels at controlling the battlefield with his magnetic abilities. Use Magnetic Pull to displace enemies or pull objects for strategic advantages. His Barrier can block key enemy attacks, allowing your team to reposition or push forward. 
            Magneto's ultimate, the Magnetic Meteor, is best used in clustered fights to deal massive damage and disrupt the enemy team. Position yourself carefully to maximize the impact of your abilities.

        <h3>Mauga</h3>
        <p>
            Mauga is a tank that thrives in controlling areas and protecting his team. Use his Barrier Shield to block incoming damage while your team advances. Rage Mode is ideal for turning the tide in close-quarters combat, as it boosts both damage and survivability. 
            His ultimate is perfect for zoning enemies or breaking through defensive setups. Coordinate with your team to capitalize on the space Mauga creates.
        </p>

    <div class="guides" id="Ramatra">
        <h3>Ramatra</h3>
        <p>
