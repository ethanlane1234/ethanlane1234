                <h3>Dive</h3>
                <p>
                    Dive compositons can really be used on any type of map. This strategy relies on useing charaters with high mobility to outmaneuver the enemy team and get picks on key targets, such as support characters. The constant threat to the back lines allows your team to engage an enemy that is distracted with a backline threat. Further if key targets are eliminated your team should be able to aggressive push the enemy team.
